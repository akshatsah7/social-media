A social media website built with React! This platform offers users a seamless experience with two distinct sections: a post creation area and a Home section. In the creation section, users can easily compose posts, including title, content of the post, and hashtags, allowing for personalized and engaging content. On the flip side, the viewing section presents posts in a clean and organized format, enabling users to browse through the latest updates. What sets this project apart is its clean interface, which allows users to effortlessly switch between the two sections and even delete posts directly from the viewing area and it also shows the engagement amount for the specific post. While the functionality is straightforward, the focus on user experience and simplicity makes this social media website a standout project for React enthusiasts and beginners.
